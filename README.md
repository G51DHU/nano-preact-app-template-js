# Nano Preact App Default Javascript Template
The default template project for [nano-preact-app](https://github.com/G51DHU/nano-preact-app-template-js).

---

>**Note:**

  - "`.js`" files wont be parsed as `.jsx`, so make sure to rename `.js` files containing `jsx` syntax to end with "`.jsx`" `instead of` "`.js`".

  - Both `npm run start` and `npm run preview` run on port 3000 by default. You can change this within `package.json`

# Purpose of each file.
When starting out a project, it's always a good idea to get an idea of the file structure.
So you should know what each file does, and the general location for where files go.

## [Vite.config.js](https://vitejs.dev/config/)
[<span style="color:lightblue">Helpful link 1</span>](https://vitejs.dev/config/) |

When running vite from the command line, Vite will automatically try to resolve a config file named vite.config.js inside project root.

## [Package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json)

This file contains information about a project's dependencies. It can also contain other metadata such as a project description, the version of the project in a particular distribution, license information and even configuration data.

This file acts as the entry into the whole website. 
When the application starts this is the first page that is loaded. This file has a line of code ```<div id=‚Äùroot‚Äù></div>```. This line is very significant since all the application components are loaded into this div.

## App.jsx

This file is like the gateway to the rest of the project. It encapsulates everything else you want and need, like other components. 

Unlike "`npx create-react-app`", with "`npx nano-react-app`" the "index.jsx" and the "app.jsx" have been combined.
And `ReactDOM.render` is replaced by `render()`.
